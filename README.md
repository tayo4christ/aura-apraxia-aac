# AURA: Adaptive Understanding and Relearning Assistant

AURA is an AI-powered therapeutic platform for supporting individuals with Apraxia of Speech (AOS). It combines speech recognition, adaptive therapy, and multimodal communication tools to support personalized and accessible intervention.

## 📸 System Architecture

See the image above for an overview of AURA’s layered system, which includes:
- **Input:** Speech and gesture capture
- **AI Modules:** Speech recognition, error classification, RL-based adaptation
- **Applications:** Gamified therapy, AAC support, caregiver dashboard
- **User Feedback:** Real-time, multimodal interaction

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the full app locally (menu-based):

```bash
python aura_launcher.py
```

Run the Streamlit web app:

```bash
streamlit run aura_streamlit_app.py
```
