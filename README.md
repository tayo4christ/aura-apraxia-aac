### 💡 Research Motivation
AURA was conceived as part of a broader research effort to build inclusive AI systems that bridge communication barriers for individuals with Apraxia of Speech (AOS) and users of Makaton — a language combining signs, symbols, and speech.
The project explores the intersection of AI-driven speech recognition, error detection, and gesture-based communication, aiming to create a seamless multimodal translation framework.
This aligns with ongoing research into how machine learning and multimodal interfaces can extend assistive communication beyond traditional therapy environments and into everyday contexts.

---

### 🌍 Accessibility Impact

- Empowers individuals with speech or motor planning difficulties to communicate through AI-assisted multimodal tools.
- Promotes early, adaptive, and remote intervention in therapeutic contexts.
- Supports inclusive education and digital accessibility for users of Makaton and related AAC systems.
- Advances the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being, and SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities) by making assistive technology scalable and research-driven.

---

### 📊 Evaluation Plan
AURA’s future evaluations will focus on both **technical performance** and **user-centered impact**:
- **Speech Accuracy:** Measure transcription and classification precision across disordered speech datasets.
- **Therapy Adaptation:** Assess response times and reinforcement effectiveness using simulated interaction data.
- **User Experience:** Conduct usability reviews with educators and speech therapists to refine multimodal feedback design.
- **System Efficiency:** Benchmark model inference and latency across devices for real-world deployment.

---

### 🔭 Future Research Directions
- Integrate **multilingual Makaton translation** for broader accessibility.
- Expand **error classification datasets** to include diverse speech conditions.
- Develop **privacy-preserving AI models** for healthcare compliance.
- Explore **Edge AI deployment** for low-power, offline therapy support.
- Investigate **cross-modal learning** between speech and gestures to improve adaptive accuracy.
