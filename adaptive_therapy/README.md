# Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Therapy

This component uses reinforcement learning (PPO) to adapt therapy exercises based on user progress.

## 🔍 Purpose
To keep therapy engaging and personalized by adjusting exercise difficulty using a reward-driven model.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Custom OpenAI Gym environment
- Policy trained using PPO from `stable-baselines3`

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
python reinforcement_learner.py
```

## Requirements
- stable-baselines3
- gym
